Education must also train one for quick, resolute and effective thinking. To think incisively and to think for one’s self is very difficult. We are prone to let our mental life become invaded by legions of half truths, prejudices, and propaganda. At this point, I often wonder whether or not education is fulfilling its purpose. A great majority of the so-called educated people do not think logically and scientifically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Even the press, the classroom, the platform, and the pulpit in many instances do not give us objective and unbiased truths. To save man from the morass of propaganda, in my opinion, is one of the chief aims of education. Education must enable one to sift and weigh evidence, to discern the true from the false, the real from the unreal, and the facts from the fiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The function of education, therefore, is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. But education which stops with efficiency may prove the greatest menace to society. The most dangerous criminal may be the man gifted with reason, but with no morals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The late Eugene Talmadge, in my opinion, possessed one of the better minds of Georgia, or even America. Moreover, he wore the Phi Beta Kappa key. By all measuring rods, Mr. Talmadge could think critically and intensively; yet he contends that I am an inferior being. Are those the types of men we call educated?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must remember that intelligence is not enough. Intelligence plus character–that is the goal of true education. The complete education gives one not only power of concentration, but worthy objectives upon which to concentrate. The broad education will, therefore, transmit to one not only the accumulated knowledge of the race but also the accumulated experience of social living.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>utkarsh</name></author><summary type="html">This is dummy content.

&lt;p&gt;So begins Hallam Hawksworth’s The Strange Adventures of a Pebble. Written in the 1920s, the book was part of a series which also included The Adventures of a Grain of Dust and A Year in the Wonderland of Trees, all of which were supposed to introduce children to the world of Natural Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In each of them, Hawksworth personifies the natural object he is exploring, and using a mixture of folk tales, scientific facts and colloquial, friendly explanations guides the reader through the history of the natural world. It’s a real thrill of a ride, dramatizing the life cycle of supposedly dull things. The Adventures of a Grain of Dust begins even more loudly than Pebble:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t want you to think that I’m boasting, but I do believe I’m one of the greatest travellers that ever was; and if anybody, living or dead, has ever gone through with more than I have I’d like to hear about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Hallam Hawksworth was the pen-name of teacher Francis Blake Atkinson. He was married to the author Eleanor Stackhouse Atkinson, author of the children’s classic Greyfriars Bobby, which was based on the (supposedly) true story of a Scottish dog who spent fourteen years guarding his masters grave. The couple were both committed to education and published a weekly magazine for Chicago high school students called The Little Chronicle, as well as working for Encyclopaedia companies later in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bucharest’s history alternated periods of development and decline from the early settlements in antiquity until its consolidation as the national capital of Romania late in the 19th century. First mentioned as the “Citadel of București” in 1459, it became the residence of the famous Wallachian prince Vlad III the Impaler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;early-18th-century-woodcut-of-bucharest&quot;&gt;Early 18th century woodcut of Bucharest&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ottomans appointed Greek administrators (Phanariotes) to run the town from the 18th century. A short-lived revolt initiated by Tudor Vladimirescu in 1821 led to the end of the rule of Constantinople Greeks in Bucharest.[19]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Old Princely Court (Curtea Veche) was erected by Mircea Ciobanul in the mid-16th century. Under subsequent rulers, Bucharest was established as the summer residence of the royal court. During the years to come, it competed with Târgoviște on the status of capital city after an increase in the importance of southern Muntenia brought about by the demands of the suzerain power – the Ottoman Empire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bucharest finally became the permanent location of the Wallachian court after 1698 (starting with the reign of Constantin Brâncoveanu).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Partly destroyed by natural disasters and rebuilt several times during the following 200 years, and hit by Caragea’s plague in 1813–14, the city was wrested from Ottoman control and occupied at several intervals by the Habsburg Monarchy (1716, 1737, 1789) and Imperial Russia (three times between 1768 and 1806). It was placed under Russian administration between 1828 and the Crimean War, with an interlude during the Bucharest-centred 1848 Wallachian revolution. Later, an Austrian garrison took possession after the Russian departure (remaining in the city until March 1857). On 23 March 1847, a fire consumed about 2,000 buildings, destroying a third of the city.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>utkarsh</name></author><category term="sticky" /><summary type="html">This is dummy content.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/images/home.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Delhi’s air amidst the lockdown</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/zdelhi-air/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Delhi's air amidst the lockdown" /><published>2019-04-16T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2019-04-16T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/zdelhi-air</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/zdelhi-air/">&lt;p&gt;The popular opinion backed by real time data has been that the nation-wide lockdown has improved the quality of air the residents of Delhi breathe. In this article we explore a few skeptical assessments to this statement using an interactive comparision of PM2.5 data taken from the US Embassay in Delhi scraped from AQICN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;onset-of-summer-improves-air-quality-every-year&quot;&gt;Onset of Summer improves Air Quality every year&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delhi’s air begins to deteriorate September end and continues to be hazardous throughout winters. However, as is clear from the plot above, starting February end, it experiences improvements in PM2.5 numbers and has done so for 3 years straight. This assessment is important because there are several articles which show only 2020’s data claiming the improvements are only because of the lockdown ignoring historical trends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;post-lockdown-period&quot;&gt;Post lockdown period&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Recommend setting the visualisation to 1m, either by using the button on the top left or sliding through the lockdown period)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting observation is that the period from 22nd March 2020 to 6th April sees a significant decrease in PM2.5, even more than is observed in 2019 or 2018. This can be attributed to the lack of cars on the roads and closure of factories. The dip however is very short-lived and come mid-April the PM values are up again identical to 2018 and 2019 numbers, even with most of the activity still shut down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;what-is-pm25&quot;&gt;What is PM2.5?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PM2.5 refers to atmospheric particulate matter (PM) that have a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers, which is about 3% the diameter of a human hair. Since they are so small and light, fine particles tend to stay longer in the air than heavier particles. This increases the chances of humans and animals inhaling them into the bodies. Owing to their minute size, particles smaller than 2.5 micrometers are able to bypass the nose and throat and penetrate deep into the lungs and some may even enter the circulatory system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-nature-economy-relation-not-so-straight-forward&quot;&gt;The nature-economy relation not so straight-forward&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unpredictibility of large physical systems is often a tough barrier in implementing sustainable urban policies. US Embassay is situated in a rather cleaner area in Delhi and I’ll soon come up with a way to examine air quality of Delhi as a whole. The covid-19 crisis has definitely reduced direct pollution from cars and factories for a while and it would be interesting to theorize on how economic activity can be regulated in the future to prevent Delhi’s air from reaching hazardous levels.&lt;/p&gt;
