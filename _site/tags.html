    "body": "2019/04/16 - The popular opinion backed by real-time data has been that the nation-wide lockdown has improved the quality of air the residents of Delhi breathe. In this article, we explore a few skeptical assessments to this statement using an interactive comparison of PM2. 5 data taken from the US Embassy in Delhi scraped from AQICN. Onset of Summer improves Air Quality every year: Delhi’s air begins to deteriorate September end and continues to be hazardous throughout winters. However, as is clear from the plot above, starting February end, it experiences improvements in PM2. 5 numbers and has done so for 3 years straight. This assessment is important because there are several articles that show only 2020’s data claiming the improvements are only because of the lockdown ignoring historical trends. Post lockdown period: (Recommend setting the visualization to 1m, either by using the button on the top left or sliding through the lockdown period) An interesting observation is that the period from 22nd March 2020 to 6th April sees a significant decrease in PM2. 5, even more than is observed in 2019 or 2018. This can be attributed to the lack of cars on the roads and closure of factories. The dip, however, is very short-lived and come mid-April the PM values are up again identical to 2018 and 2019 numbers, even with most of the activity still shut down. What is PM2. 5?: PM2. 5 refers to atmospheric particulate matter (PM) that have a diameter of less than 2. 5 micrometers, which is about 3% the diameter of a human hair. Since they are so small and light, fine particles tend to stay longer in the air than heavier particles. This increases the chances of humans and animals inhaling them into the bodies. Owing to their minute size, particles smaller than 2. 5 micrometers can bypass the nose and throat and penetrate deep into the lungs and some may even enter the circulatory system. The nature-economy relation not so straight-forward: The unpredictability of large physical systems is often a tough barrier in implementing sustainable urban policies. US Embassy is situated in a rather cleaner area in Delhi and I’ll soon come up with a way to examine air quality of Delhi as a whole. The COVID-19 crisis has reduced direct pollution from cars and factories for a while and it would be interesting to theorize on how economic activity can be regulated in the future to prevent Delhi’s air from reaching hazardous levels.
